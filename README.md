# r-style-guider

A series of short functions that use regexes to fix your code so that it complies with your preferred, or mandatory, style guide.

At the moment, this extension provides three simple functionalities:
* are you used to writing trailing commas, but your code needs to have leading commas? select all and run "move commas to a new line"
* are you used to naming your functions/variables/everythings with names_separated_by_underscores, but your names need to be camelCase? select the name of the object wherever it appears, run "fix function name (underscores to camelCase)", and every instance of the variable will be magically fixed!
* same as the previous, but going from names_separated_by_underscores to names.separated.by.dots instead of camelCase. arguably, this is not a third functionality, but... hey! look over there!
